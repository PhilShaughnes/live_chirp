# Chirp

This just playing with phoenix live-view. The base starting place is
mostly built up after Chris McCord's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZvmYaFkNJI) building up a twitter clone.

The hope is that this can be built on and used as a platform to play,
learn, and explore live-view.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
